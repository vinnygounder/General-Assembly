# Welcome to Vinny Gounder's Data Science Portfolio

Hello World! My name's Vinny Gounder.

I am a recent data science graduate from General Assembly with a background in financial services. I love using and manipulating data in order to find powerful insights that can make a tangible effect on an organisation. I enjoy digging into complex datasets and trying to turn that into a story. I also have a passion for playing World of Warcraft in my spare time and am not stranger to multitasking which I have found to have helped in terms of prioritising tasks during my transition into data science and approaching complex problems.
